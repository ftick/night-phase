  Fascists, open your eyes.
  Fascists who are not Hitler, open your eyes.
  You should see <fascists-1> other pairs of eyes.
  Your job is to play Fascist cards and protect Hitler.
  
  Hitler, stick your thumb up so that your Fascists can see you.
  Your job is to stay hidden, and become Chancellor when the time's right.
  
  Fascists, close your eyes.
  Hitler, put your thumb back down.
  
  Everyone open your eyes.
